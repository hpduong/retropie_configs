		<name>Aldynes : The Mission Code for Rage Crisis</name>
		<desc>Aldynes, full title Aldynes: The Mission Code for Rage Crisis, is a horizontal scrolling shoot 'em up game developed by Produce and released in July 22, 1991 for the SuperGrafx only for Japan. The game has a unique option-based combat and features levels with large scaling effects or parallax scrolling effects.

Nearing the year 2020, the societies of mankind fall into global depression just as an alien invasion suddenly comes down on Earth; coming from a large mechanical planetoid, the aliens attack the Earth without reason or communication. With all defenses annihilated, the United Nations corresponds with NASA to make a powerful space fighter known as The Ortega under project name Aldynes. During that time, a particular space fighter pilot - known only by his call sign Fox-A - was killed in action; his bereaved girlfriend Hiroko soon discovered Project Aldynes and its near complete fighter. As the invaders attack the air force housing Project Aldynes, she hijacks one of the ships and throws herself into battle in hopes of getting her revenge.</desc>

		<name>Battle Ace</name>
		<desc>Battle Ace is an action-oriented flight game in a first-person perspective. The player mans a space ship, including a radar which shows enemies, and the goal is to reach the end of each level where an end boss waits. As usually, the main occupation is to blast a lot of aliens which approach the player. The available weapons are bombs and a machine gun, both unlimited. Getting hit is a bad idea because it results in death. The player has three lives which can be raised by scoring 20000 points.</desc>

		<name>Magical King Granzort</name>
		<desc>In 2050, after a great earthquake, the Moon got an atmosphere and conditions for normal human life. 50 years later, the Moon is inhabited by humans and a great tourist attraction. A boy called Daichi arrives on the Moon and hears the strange stories about people with rabbit ears. Soon he meets V-Mei, an old witch and her granddaughter Guri Guri, the members of the Long-Ears race which is in war with the evil Jadou Clan who wants to conquer the world. Sensing a power in the boy, V-Mei gives the magic gun to Daichi and reveals to him that he is the chosen Madou Warrior who will save the Long-Ears race and their land Rabiluna from the evil Jadou Clan. With the magic gun, Daichi can summon Granzort ? the Madou King of Earth ? a giant robot to fight against the monsters of the Jadou Clan.

Soon, Daichi, V-Mei and Guri Guri meet two other boys ? Gus and Rabi. Gus receives a magic bow that summons Winzart ? the Madou King of Wind, while Rabi receives a magic top that summons Aquabeat ? the Madou King of Water. Together, Daichi, Gus, Rabi, V-Mei and Guri Guri travel to the world of Rabiluna in order to free it from the Jadou Clan.</desc>

		<desc>The time is yesteryear, when knights scoured the countryside in search of the Holy Grail, defended the honor of fair maidens and fought a never-ending battle against rampant evil forces. Thrown into this mayhem, is the courageous Sir Arthur. A victorious knight with the awesome task of penetrating the Demon's Castle to pulverize the Prince of Darkness. Can he do it? It's up to you. You'll dangerously travel through the Place of Execution, the Village of Decay, the Town of Fire, and the Crystal Forest with an arsenal of weapons at your side. And when you're really down on your luck, magic fights might with powerful results. The only problem? You'll have to learn how to use it. And avoid it. Because their magic has the power to change you into a helpless duck among other things. But there's not much time. Lives depend on you. So brandish your sword and make mincemeat of your foes.</desc>
